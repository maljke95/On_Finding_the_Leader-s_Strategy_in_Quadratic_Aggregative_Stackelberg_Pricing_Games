# On Finding the Leader’s Strategy in Quadratic Aggregative Stackelberg Pricing Games

**The 21st IEEE European Control Conference (ECC 2023)**, Buchurest, Romania, 14-16 June 2024.

**Abstract:** This paper analyzes a class of Stackelberg games
where different actors compete for shared resources and a
central authority tries to balance the demand through a pricing
mechanism. Situations like this can for instance occur when
fleet owners of electric taxi services compete about charging
spots. In this paper, we model the competition between the
followers as an aggregative game, i.e., each player’s decision
only depends on the aggregate strategy of the others. While
it has previously been shown that there exist dynamic pricing
strategies to achieve the central authority’s objective, we in
this paper present a method to compute optimal static prices.
Proof of convergence of the method is presented, together with
a numerical study showcasing the benefits and the speed of
convergence of the proposed method.
